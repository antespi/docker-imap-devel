# Dockerized IMAP server#

IMAP server for debugging.

**IMPORTANT**: This image is **ONLY** for developing/debugging proposes

This docker image is based on https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver
If you look for a docker image for production environment, then go here:
https://hub.docker.com/r/tvial/docker-mailserver/

This image is even simpler than `tvial` docker image. Includes only
Postfix (SMTP) and Dovecot (IMAP) servers with one catchall mailbox
`debug@localdomain.test` for all emails. So, it's very useful for debugging. Optionally, you can define another normal mailbox.

Every email received via SMTP will be delivered locally to `debug@localdomain.test`, so it's safe for testing a web application sending emails with a production list of emails.

Using your favorite email client you can connect via IMAP protocol to see emails like original recipient would received them


## Run container with docker compose

```
cp docker-compose.yml.dist docker-compose.yml
```

Edit ```docker-compose.yml``` for set these environment variables:

- MAILNAME: Mail domain (by default, `localdomain.test`)
- MAIL_ADDRESS: Normal user mailbox email address (optional)
- MAIL_PASS: Normal user mailbox password

```
docker-compose up
```

Configure your email client with these parameters and test it sending
any email to any email address
